# Alumni Donation Management System

This application, designed both on the client side by React JS
and on the server side by Firebase, is the interactive interface linking the
graduates of Meenakshi Sundararajan Engineering College to the IITS Trust,
a charitable organization committed to supporting the philanthropic endeavors.
The core purpose of this portal is to enable and make the process of donation
easy and carry support from the alumni towards the various activities of
the Trust in an interactive way. The chief feature of the application is the
mobile-friendly interface, through which alumni can get information regarding
donation opportunities and upcoming events, which will prompt him to take
swift action, thereby maintaining a continued relationship with the initiative
and ensuring a smooth donation process. The seamless, interactive experience
allows alumni to contribute easily at any time in their convenience, fostering a
sense of community and shared responsibility for the Trustâ€™s mission. Apart
from user-oriented functionalities, the application includes an administrative
dashboard that will enable the IITS Trust to manage donations and registrations
and obtain trend analysis. The admin interface would help administrators
analyze trends in donation and spot successful campaigns in giving and calibrate
future efforts to increase alumni involvement. It not only promotes the
role of technology in reconnecting alumni with their alma mater but also
goes on to show how real-time engagement tools can bring about greater
social impact. Streamlined donation procedures and insights into donor
engagement help promote ongoing interaction, enhance transparency, and
strengthen the relationship between alumni and the Trust. It finally seeks to
develop a sustaining ecosystem of philanthropy mutually beneficial for both
alumni and the Trust in order to facilitate common objectives toward societal
transformation
